=head1 NAME

Pegex::Parser - Pegex Parser Runtime

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegex::Parser;
    use SomeGrammarClass;
    use SomeReceiverClass;

    my $parser = Pegex::Parser->new(
        grammar => SomeGrammarClass->new,
        receiver => SomeReceiverClass->new,
    );

    my $result = $parser->parse($SomeInputText);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pegex::Parser is the Pegex component that provides the parsing engine
runtime. It requires a Grammar object and a Receiver object. It's C<parse()>
method takes an input that is expected to be matched by the grammar, and
applies the grammar rules to the input. As the grammar is applied, the
receiver is notified of matches. The receiver is free to do whatever it
wishes, but often times it builds the data into a structure that is commonly
known as a Parse Tree.

When the parse method is complete it returns whatever object the receiver
has provided as the final result. If the grammar fails to match the input
along the way, the parse method will throw an error with much information
about the failure.
